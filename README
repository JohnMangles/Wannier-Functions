Code for John Mangles' Masters thesis Second Degree Localization in Twisted Bilayer Graphene.

Graphene Script generates a periodic grid corresponding to the locations of the nuclei of the atoms in a single layer of graphene.

sRRQR is a Strong Rank Revealing QR factorizing algorithm. Given an input matrix A and rank r, it returns a QR factorization of A limited to the specified rank 
(e.g. a rank 10 A passed in with r = 3 would return a rank 3 QR facorization corresponding to the leading 3 eigenvectors/eigenvalues of A)

GrapheneWannier calls the afformentioned functions. Using Graphene Script twice it creates a layered grid that corresponds to twisted bilayer graphene,
Then a periodic matrix corresponding to the energy of the system is created and fed into sRRQR to return the leading vectors of interest.
A Fourier transformation is then taken so our computations can be performed efficiently, and our results are brought back to real space with an inverse
Fourier transformation. Lastly, the energy levels of interest are plotted once they have been computed.
